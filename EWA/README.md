# Exponentially Weighted Average (ewa)

This function takes the exponentially weighted average of temperature at time t for temperature data created from a uniform distribution. A beta value closer to 0 will make the ewa react much more quickly to changes near time t, while beta values closer to 1 will make the ewa at time t more tolerant to recent changes.
